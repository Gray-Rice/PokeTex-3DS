# PokeTex-3DS

This repository aims to be an archive for 3DS Pokemon texture packs from a Citra project forum now taken down by nintendo.I am creating this archive so anyone in the future would find it usefull for their playthrough.

## DISCLAIMER: I do not claim these work as my own, this can be considered just an archive for most purposes. With sole exception of some textures for Pokemon X which contain textures I personally worked on. The credits are for the respective creators who spent their time to create these.
