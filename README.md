# PokeTex-3DS

This repository serves as an archive for 3DS Pokémon texture packs originally shared on the Citra project forum, which has since been taken down by Nintendo. My goal is to preserve these texture packs so that future players can access them for their playthroughs.<br>

### Disclaimer: I do not claim ownership of these works; Full credit goes to the original creators (credited below) who spent their valuable time making these textures.<br> Therefore this repository can be considered an archive for most parts.<br>
That being said, HD texture pack for Pokemon X and Y does include additional textures created by me.

## **Usage**  
1. Check the [Releases](https://github.com/Gray-Rice/PokeTex-3DS/releases) section for available texture packs.<br>
2. Extract the packs and rename the folder according to the corresponding game’s title ID.<br> 
3. Place the folder in the `Textures` directory of your emulator.<br>
   These packs should work with Citra and its forks.

The *Pokémon X & Y* texture pack is still a work in progress.<br>
UI,Text and most other elements are done, making the experience somewhat better although not perfect.<br>
More textures may be added if I manage to dump textures from a rom or complete the game, but there are no guarantees.
